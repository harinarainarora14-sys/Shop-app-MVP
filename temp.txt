The following dependencies need to be installed:
1. jsQR for QR code scanning
2. react-webcam for camera access

Please run these commands in your terminal to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install jsqr react-webcam
# or
pnpm add jsqr react-webcam
# or
yarn add jsqr react-webcam
```

Then, make sure you have the SQL migrations in order:

1. Run the base migrations first (001-006)
2. Run the new migrations in order:
   - 007_chat_tables.sql
   - 008_enhance_messages.sql
   - 009_add_waiting_list_count.sql

You can run them through your Supabase dashboard or using the Supabase CLI with:

```bash
supabase db reset
# or
supabase migration up
```

Finally, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000
